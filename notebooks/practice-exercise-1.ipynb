    "# Practice exercise: Geospatial Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a short practice exercise for developing a machine learning model using `scikit-learn`. The task is to predict leaf area index (LAI) using predictor variables derived from a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2_SR_HARMONIZED\" target=\"_blank\">Sentinel-2 satellite image</a> and topographic variables. The LAI measurements were derived from LiDAR data with a 30 cm spatial resolution and 15 cm vertical resolution averaged to a 10 m spatial resolution to match the size of Sentinel-2 pixels. \n",
    "\n",
    "LAI is a measure of the total area of leaves relative to the ground area and is an important biophysical variable for studying vegetation growth and functioning. The data we are using here were collected over the Marburg Forest in Germany and are from the paper by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304380019303230\" target=\"_blank\">Meyer et al.
